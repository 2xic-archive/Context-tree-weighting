# CTW
Compression is cool! CTW is great, however it is resource intensive and why huffman (en)coding is popular.
CTW is using arithmetic encoding, I would suggest first coding an implementation using interval as fractions before moving to a version using intervals as bit-precision. 

### Example
The input.txt file was compressed with this script. The content of that file was generated by [this page](http://randomtextgenerator.com). The file "encoded" is the results of that compression. I also included a classical zipped version of the input.txt file to show the file difference **(1699 bytes CTW vs 2427 bytes zip)**.
